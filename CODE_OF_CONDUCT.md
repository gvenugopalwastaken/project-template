# Code of Conduct (a.k.a. Don’t Be *That* Engineer)

Welcome! By interacting with this repo, you agree to follow these sacred laws:

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Be Nice(ish)
- No harassment, discrimination, or passive-aggressive commit messages.
- Sarcasm is encouraged, but cruelty is not.
- Remember: behind every PR is a sleep-deprived human (probably you, in 6 months).

---

## 🤡 Keep It Fun
- Memes are valid documentation.  
- Dad jokes are mandatory in code comments.  
- The first person to suggest rewriting in Rust must also maintain it forever.  

---

## 💻 Coding Etiquette
- Tabs vs spaces → discuss like civilized adults (i.e., loudly, in Slack).  
- Naming things is hard, so we forgive `final_final_v2.py`.  
- If your code works only on your machine, you must ship your machine with it.  

---

## 🚫 Things That Will Get You Banned
- Checking in secrets to GitHub. (Unless it’s your Netflix password, in which case: thanks.)  
- Arguing that semicolons in Python are “fine.”  
- Starting a flamewar over Vim vs Emacs. (We all know it’s VS Code anyway.)  

---

## ✅ Golden Rule
Write code like the next person to read it is a vengeful ex who knows where you live.
