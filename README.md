# 🧩 Untitled Engineering Chaos

Welcome to the boilerplate nobody asked for, but everybody secretly needs.  
This is your blank canvas for side projects, over-engineered scripts, or that “one small tool” that will spiral into a microservice farm.

---

## 🗂 What’s Inside
- `src/` → where the magic *should* happen, but probably won’t.  
- `tests/` → contains a single test that proves math still works.  
- `docs/` → a place to dump wisdom, rants, and ASCII art.  
- `.github/` → because what’s a project without CI silently judging you?

---

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd project-name
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
python src/main.py
```

If nothing breaks, congrats: you’re either a genius or didn’t run it right.

## 📜 License
MIT — do whatever, just don’t blame me when it sets your production cluster on fire.

## 🎯 Pro Tips
- Commit often, regret later.  
- CI only fails on Fridays.  
- Rename this repo something cooler before anyone sees it.

Made with ☕, bad decisions, and the illusion of productivity.
