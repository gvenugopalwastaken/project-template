# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for considering ruining—uh, *contributing to this project.*

## Rules
- Commit often, even if it’s just `fix stuff` or `typo`.
- Tests are optional, vibes are mandatory.
- Code reviews will be harsh, but only because misery loves company.
- PR titles must be witty. “bug fix” = ❌ | “the bug has been yeeted” = ✅

## How to Contribute
1. Fork this repo (you break it, you bought it).
2. Branch off `main` because YOLO.
3. Push commits with questionable code.
4. Open a PR and pray the CI overlords are merciful.
