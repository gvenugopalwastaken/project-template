# 🛠 Getting Started

So you’ve decided to run this project. Bold choice. Here’s how to survive:

---

## ☕ Step 1: Essential Preparation
- Run `make coffee` (required, not optional).  
- If it fails, upgrade to `make double-espresso`.  
- Still broken? `brew whiskey` (debug mode).  

---

## 💻 Step 2: Setup Ritual
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd project-name
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If any of these fail, congratulations — you’ve reproduced the maintainer’s daily workflow.  

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Verification
```bash
pytest
```
If all tests pass, double-check you’re in the right repo.  

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Actually Run It
```bash
python src/main.py
```
Expected: a warm welcome.  
Actual: chaos.  

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Production (Not Recommended)
- Push to main.  
- Pray.  
- Update your résumé.  

---

*Pro Tip: Half the battle is convincing yourself this project is “just a prototype.”*
